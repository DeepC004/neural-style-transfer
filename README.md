# CS F425 - Deep Learning

Perform Depth Aware Neural Style Transfer using Style, Content and Depth Loss on VGGNet backbone. This project is part of Deep Learning coursework.

# Process Workflow

Use collab for easier and faster performance.

1. Download the requirements like Tensorflow, Keras, etc

2. Run `codes/main.py` to run and train the model.

3. Tweak the total iteration and output image generation as per your need.
